Just make sure you have python 3.x installed

I believe this is everyones default directory for slay the spire directory, I have windows 10 x64 though, 
you may have to change the directory and delete the x86 if you are using windows x86

C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\SlayTheSpire\betaPreferences\
C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\SlayTheSpire\preferences\
