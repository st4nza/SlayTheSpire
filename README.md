# SlayTheSpire
always whale option

Just make sure you have python 3.x installed

I believe this is everyones default directory for slay the spire directory:
C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\SlayTheSpire\betaPreferences\
C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\SlayTheSpire\preferences\

Make surue you use the corresponding script for beta and non beta

Also make sure the format of your STSPlayer is as follows (can be found in above directory):

{
  "alias": "tc9o1agmuvu0giyi",
  "ftuePopupShown": "true",
  "name": "Players Name",
  "IRONCLAD_SPIRITS": "0",
  "THE_SILENT_SPIRITS": "0",
  "DMG_DEALT": "1508"
}

For some reason the one in beta was spaced outlike this, but the one in non beta was in a single line.
If you don't see a new line after every comma, simply just press enter after every comma to make
it look nice and hit save :D
