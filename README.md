Just make sure you have python 3.x installed

I believe this is everyones default directory for slay the spire directory:
C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\SlayTheSpire\betaPreferences\
C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\SlayTheSpire\preferences\

Make surue you use the corresponding script for beta and non beta
